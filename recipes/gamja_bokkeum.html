        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30g) sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium clove garlic (5g), finely grated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>10 ounces (285g) small Yukon Gold potatoes, rinsed and halved</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (6g) toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, water, sugar, and garlic until sugar is dissolved, about 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a 3-quart saucier or saucepan. Add potatoes, arranging them cut-side down in a single layer. Set saucier over medium-high heat and cook, uncovered, until potatoes are light golden-brown on cut-side, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lower heat to medium-low, add soy sauce mixture and stir to combine with potatoes. Cover saucier with a lid, and cook until potatoes are completely tender and offer no resistance when pierced with a cake tester or paring knife, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove lid and increase heat to high. Cook, uncovered, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until liquid has reduced and thickened to a sticky caramel consistency that fully glazes the potatoes, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and transfer potatoes to serving bowl. Drizzle with sesame oil, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
