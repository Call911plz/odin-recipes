            A college student altered recipe of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj7UfZR_yqA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon Ramsay's Mushroom, Leek and Tarragon Pasta.</a> 
            This recipe assumes the chef to be broke and on a budget. Feel free to replace certain aspects with other alternatives.
            Different protein like day old chicken wings or uneaten hamburger patties can be substituted. Free vegetables 
            from college food programs and other "sources" can be used instead of leeks. Other unused pastas and soups can be used
            instead of the instant ramen. Any spices from the communal kitchen is encouraged to be appropriated and used.
        </p>
